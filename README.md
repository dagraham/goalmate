<p><b>goalmate</b> supports setting goals such as "exercise 3/7d -1" which would set a goal for exercising 3 times every 7 days and warning if the number of times in the past 7 days falls below the goal-1. The warning is optional and, with a plus sign instead of a minus sign, would warn when the number is exceeds goal+1.
